# Installation

To build the website on your PC

* Make sure you have installed PHP and MySQL
* Clone the repo on your local machine (in htdocs folder or wherever you configured your server's root)
* Initialize the database by opening http://localhost/install.php

The website uses password-compat library to encrypt passwords, so you should install that as well.
We'll use the PHP package manager, composer to do this:

* cd to root folder of project
* install composer by running the command `php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php`
* then run `php composer.phar install`
